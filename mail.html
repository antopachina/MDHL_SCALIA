<p></p> <p> Hi,</p>
Here are my ideas for the website. They're not fancy, but they
should give you an idea of what we are looking for. We can
worry about a nicer look for the site later. For now, I'd like to
focus on getting some basic content about the league up for our
current and prospective members and their parents. (And no,
not everyone in our league is on Facebook! We need our own
site.) <p></p>
<p> There are places in the sketch where I'd like you to put our logo
and some images (see attachments). For sample content on
each page, you can use what is in the sketch. We'll probably add
some more content later.</p> <p></p>
<p> For now, you can just send me a zip file of the website once
you're done.</p> <p></p>
